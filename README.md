# Robot_localization_and_mapping
This project implements robot localization and mapping using ROS and simulation tools. The goal is to enable a mobile robot to understand its position in an unknown environment while building a consistent map for navigation.


1.Localization – Estimates the robot’s pose (position and orientation) using sensor data (LIDAR, odometry, IMU, etc.).

2.Mapping – Builds 2D/3D maps of the environment in real-time.

3.SLAM Integration – Combines mapping and localization (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for autonomous navigation.

4.ROS Support – Compatible with ROS1/ROS2 for easy integration with Gazebo, RViz, and navigation stacks.

5.Custom Robot Model – Works with differential drive mobile robots equipped with LIDAR and depth cameras.
